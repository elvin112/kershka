I implemented and tested favorites and basket slice but I couldn't test the authSlice, 
it must be tested after creation of auth operations.

Because of we are allowing users to put an item to the favorites or basket,
I implemented Async storage for these operations, when implementing favoritesScreen and basketScreen,
First you must check if there is an item in AsyncStorage then move on to the application.
It is just like how we stored and retrived authentication tokens
The difference between auth tokens and favorite items/basket items is,
In favorite items we store Json stringified arrays, we have to do it because Async Storage doesn't allow to store,
Data types other than strings.
So when you will read this data use JSON.parse
I implemented them in the test files you can check them

In firebase authTokens expire after an hour therefore I implemented an expirationDate field to state and to AsyncStorage
You must either automatically log out the user after expiration time or send a request to refresh token api end point
Refresh token api endpoint would be better for user experience.
